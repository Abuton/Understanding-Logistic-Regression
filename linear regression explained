## Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study and understand relationships between two or more continuous (quantitative) variables. This means that it deals
with continous values like (1.2, 5, 3.2, 8) etc.
Essentially, linear regression is used to assess the strength of the relationship between variables and for modeling the future relationship between them.

Linear Regression is just a small part of Regression. Regression models includes several kinds, which include the linear regression, multiple linear regression, and nonlinear. 
The most common models are simple linear and multiple linear. The simple linear is also termed as the linear regression.
Nonlinear regression analysis is commonly used for more complicated data sets in which the dependent and independent variables show a nonlinear relationship. Examples of Non linear 
regression models are the Decision Tree models, Forest models etc. These methods does not assume linear relationships exists amongest features, it uses other intuitions like 
generating new rules based on hidden patterns that exist within the data.

Linear model assumptions
Linear regression analysis is based on some fundamental assumptions:

1. The predictor and target variables show a linear relationship between the slope and the intercept.
2. The value of the residual (error) is zero.
3. The independent variable is not random.
4. The residual (error) values follow the gaussian distribution.

### Simple linear regression model is expressed using the following equation:

`**Y = a + bX + C**`

Where

Y = dependent (target) variable

a = Intercept

b = co-efficient(slope)

X = independent (predictor) variable

C = Residual (constant)

### Multiple linear regression
